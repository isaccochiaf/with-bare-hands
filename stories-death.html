                Nezam is lying on his bed, a dirty sheet around his waist. His mother sits at his bedside. Every now and then she gets close and turns him over, just to move him a bit. She cleans him up and tries to understand what he is struggling to say. He is 37, Nezam, and it’s now nine years that he has been living in his bed, paralyzed, since the 2nd of April 2007, when, while working on the Mahin Enterprise construction site, a steel cable broke and hit him, with appalling violence, in the back, breaking his spinal cord. “I’m slowly dying – says Nezam, who in the past few months has seen his health decline – and no one can do anything about it. My mother, who dreamed for me a bright future, can only spend her days at my bedside, watching me fade away , day by day”. After a long legal battle, compensation has been paid to Nezam, amounting to 125000 BDT, which is about 1.400 euros. Nothing compared to a life that has been destroyed. With that money he bought a small kiosk on the street, where he sells food, and with that he manages to make enough money to keep his family and himself. A family living on the eldest son’s shoulders, being forced to sell the small patch of land that it owned, in order to pay for the cure and medicines for that son. “What I want is justice – whispers Nezam – I lost everything. I was about to get married, no one ever comes to visit me. The boss of the construction site washed his hands of me, giving me a bit over one thousand euros”.

                Shipbreaking is also this. It’s a dangerous job, probably one of the most dangerous in the world, and it happens in countries like Bangladesh, where they use un-qualified people, mostly youngsters, in unhealthy working conditions. Accidents happen daily, and there are dozens of deaths every year. Security is a stranger on these sites; workers go about wearing flip-flops and short-sleeved T-shirts, no helmets, no goggles. They climb up ladders suspended at many dozens of meters above the rough seas; they juggle with blow-torches close to reservoirs, tanks and gas canisters. Explosions are frequent, as the burns show on those who handle these torches. Sometimes the burns are minor and can be treated in the crowded and decaying hospital of Chittagong; other times the burns are so severe that the doctors have not got the competence or the means to treat them, and so the injured workers remain there for weeks, if not months, lying in a bed and receiving the minimum essential treatment. This is the case of Sheju Moni and Tapas Jaladas, who saw two gas reservoirs explode in their faces while they were cutting into pieces the metal slabs of a cargo ship. Sheju is still in hospital, in serious condition. He has been there for months now, with 80% of his body burnt. Tapas recovered from his accident which happened in January 2014 on the Kabir Steel’s construction site. Recovered but scarred forever: his arms, a part of his face and his neck devoured by the flames. “After the accident it took me several months to recover – says Tapas – the company, after the basic treatments, stopped paying for the medicines, so I had to pay everything myself and as I was not working I was not earning money either. Now I’m back at work, the same routine, the same dangers. But I have got no choice, it’s the only opportunity I’ve got to survive”.

                Nezam, Tapas, Sheju, or even Edris, who lost a leg in an accident and from then on manages to scrape by with his family, are only a few of the victims of the high risk activity of shipbreaking. Victims who, even through tragedy, are lucky enough to be able to tell us their stories. Lucky enough because there are many who lose their lives on these sites. Even if it is difficult to make a precise estimate because many of the workers are not even registered, (they are immigrants and therefore have no family in Chittagong), around one thousand people have lost their lives from the ‘80’s up until today. Just in the first months of 2016, thirteen deaths were registered.

                Amongst these was Sumon, 26, who had recently become a father. Sumon was leaving the Kabir Steel construction site at the end of his day’s work, where he was an assistant cutter. A lorry, manoeuvring, ran over him and killed him right there. It was the 28th of March, 2016. “I saw my husband leave to go to work, and never saw him come back – says Jasmin Akter, Sumon’s young wife, in her room in the small village of Masjidga – I knew it was a dangerous job, he used to tell me that all the time. He said there was no safety, too many people were getting injured. I even had to fight to get his body back”. Yes, because the Kabir Steel, and the local authorities, tried to hide Sumon’s corpse, and did not want to give it back to his family. Only a protest carried out by friends and family made it possible for his dear ones to get his corpse back. A protest that was not painless. During the demonstration outside the Kabir Steel’s yard some of the guards opened fire on the people asking for the dead body of Sumon. Dozens were injured, hit by bullets coming from the towers on the walls surrounding these sites, which seem impenetrable from the outside. Also in the case of Sumon, Kabir Steel gave his family a compensation of about 1.100 euros. “Money they still have not had access to – says Jasmin – and it will serve me little purpose. With a little girl and no job I don’t know how long I will be able to resist”.

                Feet are sinking in mud and slime, water is practically coming into the house. The only protection for the houses where Mahmud Jamal, and his family and friends, have been living for years now, are just a few plastic bags. In the village of Middle Akilpur, the water is slowly flooding everything. Where once there were fields, there are now marshes. “ Most of us are farmers in these villages – explains Mahmud Jamal – but it has been a few years now that we cannot work the land anymore. Salt water has invaded the land, and if once we managed to have two crops a year, now we cannot have even one”. The rising sea level is one of the worst issues that Bangladesh now has to deal with. Its morphology, its climate, the fact that it is floating on an immense delta, exposed to more and more recurring and devastating typhoons, makes it the ideal victim of climatic change. But what puts the future at risk for Mahmud Jamal, and the other inhabitants of this village, is not just climate change. “Before the shipbreaking yards got close to our homes, we had minor problems– he goes on – Then they started cutting down the mangroves, which have been a barrier protecting us from the rising water since forever, and they started digging out the sand, destroying the natural barriers which were protecting our villages. And now, here we are in this situation, exposed to sea storms, we cannot work the land anymore, and our feet are perpetually underwater”.

                The inhabitants of Middle Akilpur have tried to raise their voices: they got in touch with the local deputies, they pressed shipbreaking yard owners so that they would take their responsibilities; yet nothing has been done, and nothing has changed. The coast continues to be destroyed, and so does its fragile ecosystem. According to an estimation done by the Bangladeshi NGO YPSA, in the past few years about sixty thousand mangrove trees have been cut down along the fourteen kilometres of coast departing from the city of Chittagong, to make space for the ships. Mangroves are essential for this fragile ecosystem, and are the last barrier against typhoons and floods. In 2009, fourteen thousand mangroves, planted with the support of the UN, with the aim of protecting the local communities from the devastating impact of climatic change, were pulled down to make space for a large number of yards for ship-breaking. Among the people in charge of the shipbreaking yards, there was a Member of Parliament for Bangladesh. “They come here at night, cut down the trees and then leave. We barely have time to realize what’s going on,” says Mahmud Jamal. In 2010, the High Court of Bangladesh condemned four shipbreaking yards to shut down and replant the mangroves that had been cut down. Yet they had to wait until October 2013 to see the so-declared illegal shipbreaking yards actually close down.

                Today, some plants are starting to grow again, some trunks can be spotted among the skeletons of the cargo ships and oil tankers which, non-stop, are brought here, to this coast, to die. But all this is still not enough to shelter those who, like Mahmud Jamal, live along a shore regularly stricken by typhoons and inundations that flood the villages, leaving thousands of families with no homes or jobs. The presence of trees all along the coast helps to prevent erosion of the coast and limits the damage from floods; the “land-grabbing” and the exploitation of the soil by the hand of the shipbreakers put at risk the ecosystem, which is already deeply compromised due to the heavy pollution coming from the shipbreaking yards which discharge enormous quantities of toxic and highly-polluting substances onto the beaches and into the sea. The inhabitants of the coastal villages try to protect themselves with barriers made of earth and stone blocks, but after a few sea storms, they fall down and leave room for the seawater. “There is nothing we can do. Now, it’s seawater getting into our homes, but soon it will be the bulldozers that will come here and take everything away from us – says Mahmud Jamal discouraged - Bit by bit, centimetre after centimetre, the yards are taking over the entire coast, and will soon arrive here. And with them, the end will also come for all those people who have lived here for centuries, farming and breeding”.
